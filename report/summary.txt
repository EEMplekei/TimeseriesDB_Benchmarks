In this paper, our objective is to conduct a comparative analysis of InfluxDB and TimescaleDB, focusing on insertion speeds, disk size, and query speeds in both single node and multi-node deployments using IoT data. Our findings reveal that InfluxDB and TimescaleDB exhibit comparable insertion speeds, while InfluxDB outperforms in average query speeds. However, it is important to note that this discrepancy is partially attributed to three specific queries that exhibit significantly longer execution times in TimescaleDB. This observation diverges from conclusions drawn in publicly available benchmarks, where existing research suggests that InfluxDB excels in smaller databases, experiencing performance degradation as data sizes increase, with Timescale outperforming InfluxDB in such scenarios. It is crucial to acknowledge the limitations imposed by our hardware resources, encompassing CPU, memory, and disk storage, which may constrain our capacity to scale up data and conduct experiments as the dataset size expands significantly.
