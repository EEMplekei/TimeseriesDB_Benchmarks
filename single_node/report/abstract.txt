In the era characterized by the prevalence of sensors and the Internet of Things, timestamped data has become ubiquitous across diverse large-scale information systems, spanning from financial indices to physical measurements. The imperative for facile and efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data has reached unprecedented levels, prompting numerous renowned data engineering and database enterprises to proffer specialized solutions tailored for timestamped data. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of two prominent database systems within this domain, evaluating their performance, compression techniques, and multi-node scalability. Specifically, the selected database systems under scrutiny are InfluxDB and TimescaleDB, widely acknowledged as preeminent products in terms of performance, maturity, and seamless integration.

This paper aims to assist decision-makers, developers, and data engineers in making informed choices based on the specific requirements of their time-sensitive applications.
